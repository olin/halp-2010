('Olin Fall 09','AHSE 3599','IP for Engineers','Special Topics in Business and Entrepreneurship: Intellectual Property for Engineers and Scientists','D. Kerns, S. Gold','2 AHSE','2-0-4','','AHSE 1500','Fall','This course introduces the fundamentals of intellectual property (IP): patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks. There is an emphasis on patent protection for inventions, and a major project component of the course in which each student will create elements of patent applications that will be peer-reviewed in student teams. Topics include introduction to patent law, identifying what is patentable, tests for patentability, patent searches to identify prior art and as a resource for further innovation, the structure of a patent, reading and drafting patent claims, the patent prosecution process, international patents, commercialization of patent rights, protecting software, Olin College’s unique IP policy, and the basics of trade secrets and copyrights.

('Olin Fall 09','ENGR 3299','PDD','Special Topics in Design Engineering: Product Design and Development','Sabin','4 ENGR','','','ENGR 2250','Fall','PD&amp;D is a hands-on class where teams of students from Babson, the Rhode Island School of Design and Olin conceive of and design new products. By the end of the semester, teams will have novel product designs that are ready to go to market. We will get there by following the design process from opportunity recognition to prototype. We will emphasize developing products that meet users needs and have a viable path to market. This course will be an opportunity to work closely with students from different fields of study. It will be a chance to work on a cross-functional team similar to product development teams you may work on in industry. Class will be held at all three schools. Transportation to class will be provided, but additional meetings with team members will require travel to RISD: approximately 1 hr from Olin.'),
('Olin Fall 09','ENGR 3499/F09','Nonlinear Circuits','Special Topics in Electrical and Computer Engineering: Nonlinear Circuit Analysis','Mur-Miranda','4 ENGR','','','ENGR 2420','Fall','Nonlinear circuits are commonly used in the design of electrical systems. Examples include sinusoidal generators, relaxation oscillators, power supplies, DC-DC converters, and signal transducers. Students will characterize the behavior of several of these circuits using state- space tools together with linear circuit theory. The results will be used to design physical implementations. Emphasis will be placed on the validation of theory using empirical data.'),

A wide range of tools will be used from electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and materials science. The use of MEMS in a wide range of applications will be considered including: optical MEMS, BioMEMS, MEMS for power and energy harvesting, microfluidic MEMS, MEMS sensors such as motion detection, chemical detection, acoustics, actuators such as micromotors, and &quot;lab on a chip&quot; MEMS. Basic semiconductor processing will be reviewed, and the special processing utilized to produce bulk silicon MEMS and surface micromachined devices. Other fabrication processes such as the LIGA process, PDMS and others will also be reviewed'),
('Olin Fall 09','ENGR 3399','Mech Aerospace','Special Topics in Mechanical Engineering: Mechanical and Aerospace Systems I','Lee, Prechtl','4 ENGR','4-0-8','','ENGR 3330','Fall','In this project-based course, student teams working in an environment like that of a small engineering research and development company will develop a mechanical or aerospace system to address a current market need. Projects will be selected from a range of proposed topics. The course will focus on clearly scoping the design endeavor and performing a comprehensive system specification and analysis of performance. An emphasis is placed on quantitative analysis. Combined thermal/fluid and structural analyses will be performed using commercial software. The final deliverable is a complete specification of the system design, including performance metrics, an estimate of system performance, and instructions for manufacture.'),
('Olin Fall 09','SCI 1130','Mechanics','Mechanics','Christianson, Zastavker','4 SCI','','','','Fall','This course provides a thorough introduction to classical mechanics. Topics include kinematics, the basis of Newton’s laws, particle dynamics, the concepts of momentum, work, energy, and rotational motion, and oscillations. Additionally, the course  will establish the basics of solid and fluid mechanics, concluding with introductory topics in thermodynamics. On a fundamental level the goal for the courses is to share with students the excitement of discovering the material universe and to equip students with the basic knowledge and analytical skills necessary to become a scientist or and engineer. This course is offered in two different flavors. Course sections with a prefix of A are taught as Theoretical Mechanics. Course sections with a prefix of L are taught as Experimental Mechanics and are laboratory based.');
