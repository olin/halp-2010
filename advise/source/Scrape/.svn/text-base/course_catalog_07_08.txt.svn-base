From its inception, Olin College has been about innovation and high standards. Our curriculum is the product of an unusual collaboration among faculty, staff, and students that is aimed 


at continually improving our 
academic program. In a sense, 
our curriculum will never be 
a finished product. We will 
always be enhancing it in 
pursuit of our mission of 
providing a superb engineering education to the nation’s brightest and most enterprising students. 
As you will see when you look through this catalog, Olin’s academic program consists of more than just traditional engineering courses. Olin students often work in interdisciplinary teams in a project-based learning environment. The curriculum provides not only a first-rate engineering education, but also opportunities to explore entrepreneurship and a broad selection of the liberal arts. 
Olin views its program as a “learning continuum” that connects and often blends the formal academic program to co-curricular activities, research with faculty, clubs, community service and “Passionate Pursuits.” The learning continuum is vital for the kind of vibrant, student-centered culture we have created at Olin — a culture that fosters hands-on learning, creativity, entrepreneurial thinking, and discovery. We invite you to explore Olin College.

Olin History 

Olin, the Man 

Franklin W. Olin (1860–1951) was an engineer, entrepreneur, and professional baseball player. Raised in Vermont lumber camps and lacking a high school diploma, he qualified for entrance to Cornell University through self-instruction. At Cornell he majored in civil engineering and was captain of the baseball team. He even played major league baseball during the summers to finance his education. He went on to found the company known today as the Olin Corporation, a Fortune 1000 company. 

Olin, the Foundation: F. W. Olin Foundation 

In 1938, Mr. Olin transferred a large part of this personal wealth to a private philanthropic foundation. Over the subsequent two-thirds of a century, the F. W. Olin Foundation awarded grants totaling nearly $800 million to construct and fully equip 78 buildings on 58 independent college campuses. Recipients include Babson, Bucknell, Carleton, Case-Western, Colgate, Cornell, DePauw, Harvey Mudd, Johns Hopkins, Marquette, Rose-Hulman Institute, Tufts, University of San Diego, University of Southern California, Vanderbilt and Worcester Polytechnic. In 2004 the Foundation announced its intention to transfer its remaining assets to Olin College and close its doors. This final grant brings the Foundation’s total commitment to Olin College to more than $460 million, which is one of the largest such commitments in the history of American higher education. 

Olin, the Vision 
Starting in the late 1980’s, the National Science Foundation and engineering community at-large began calling for reform in engineering education. In order to serve the needs of the growing global economy, it was clear that engineers needed to have business and entrepreneurship skills, creativity and an understanding of the social, political and economic contexts of engineering. The F. W. Olin Foundation decided the best way to maximize its impact was to create a college from scratch to address these emerging needs. 


Olin, the College 
The Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering received its educational charter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1997, the same year the Foundation announced its ambitious plans for the college. Planning and architectural design work for a state-of-the-art campus began almost immediately. By the end of 1999, the new institution’s leadership team had been hired and site development work commenced on 70 acres adjacent to Babson College. Olin’s first faculty members joined the college by September 2000. 
The college officially opened in fall 2002 to its inaugural freshman class. In the year prior to the opening, 30 student “partners” worked with Olin’s world-class faculty to create and test an innovative curriculum that infused a rigorous engineering education with business and entrepreneurship as well as the arts, humanities and social sciences. They developed a hands-on, interdisciplinary approach that better reflects actual engineering practice. State-of-the-art facilities matched with first-rate students, nationally renowned professors and unbridled enthusiasm, have quickly established Olin as a nationally recognized center for innovation and excellence in engineering education. Olin graduated its first class in May 2006.

They will understand the broad social, economic and ethical implications of their work, and will be cognizant of their professional responsibilities. 

2. 
They will have a solid grounding in fundamental principles of science and engineering and the ability to apply this knowledge to the design, analysis, and diagnosis of engineering systems. They will be able to develop creative design solutions that are responsive to technical, social, economic and other realistic considerations. 

3. 
They will demonstrate the results of a broad education that spans math, science, engineering, the arts, humanities, social sciences, and entrepreneurship. They will build on this foundation throughout their careers by engaging in independent learning in order to identify and respond to emerging technical and social developments. 



Pedagogy 
Olin College’s educational perspective provides a distinctive student experience designed to foster student engagement and development. Some of the key features of the Olin College experience are described in the following paragraphs. 
Hands-On Learning 
Olin has a strong commitment to incorporating hands-on educational experiences through lab and project work in many courses. From the outset of the curriculum, students build technical knowledge and develop practical skills by analyzing, designing, or fabricating engineering systems. First year Integrated Course Blocks (ICBs) provide hands-on projects involving the modeling, simulation, and analysis of engineering systems. Science courses offer opportuni-ties for experimental design and the use of modern instrumentation and testing techniques. The design stream offers opportunities for students to design, prototype, and test solutions to authentic problems. 



Open-Ended Project-Based Learning 

Throughout the curriculum, Olin students gradually build competency in solving open-ended problems. Projects are found in all four years of the curriculum, and project experiences gradually increase in scale, complexity, and realism as students develop their knowledge and skills. In open-ended projects, student teams identify and define problems, assess opportunities, apply technical knowledge, demonstrate understanding of contextual factors, muster appropriate resources to solve problems, and apply skills such as teamwork, communication, and idea generation. Olin’s open-ended project emphasis culminates in an ambitious two-semester SCOPE project that engages student teams in significant design problems with realistic constraints. 

Multidisciplinary Integration 

Olin experiences are designed to build connections between fundamental science, mathematics, and engineering; between different fields of engineering; between the arts, humanities and social sciences and technical disciplines; and between business, entrepreneurship, and technology. As a result, the Olin curriculum is conceived and taught in a highly interdisciplinary way. 
In the first year, students learn in Integrated Course Blocks (ICBs) designed to take advantage of the synergies that exist among mathematics, science, and engineering topics, including coordinated opportunities for students to apply fundamental math and science to real engineering problems and that further elucidate important linkages among disciplinary topics. 
In addition to the first-year ICBs, Olin builds multidisciplinary connections through tightly coupled, faculty team-taught courses such as the Paul Revere: Tough as Nails course block that links history of technology with materials science. Many other courses feature teaching or visits from faculty members who share different perspectives and thereby help students understand the broader context and implications of their work. 


Competency Assessment 
In addition to course-based graduation requirements, Olin develops and assesses student growth in a number of overarching competency areas. Through Olin’s competency learning and assessment system, students demonstrate skill in essential areas such as communication, qualitative understanding and quantitative analysis, teamwork, contextual thinking, opportunity assessment, diagnosis, design, and lifelong learning. 

Feedback 
Olin College fosters a culture of continual feedback and improvement. Olin’s curriculum, courses, and extra-curricular activities are shaped by student input and feedback. Faculty solicit student feedback and routinely adjust course direction and areas of emphasis to better address student educational needs. Students are expected to be active learners and participants in the process of continual improvement. 


Individualized and Student-Designed Options 
Olin students may design or customize many aspects of their educational experience. Many Olin courses include student-designed components such as projects, self-study modules, and selection of emphasis areas. More substantial student-designed and student-driven learning may be found in the following activities: 
Self-Study The Olin Self Study (OSS) is a four-credit institutional requirement in which each student works independently to select and study a body of literature in an area of interested. It is an opportunity to develop the skills and attitudes of life-long learning, a competency Olin considers vital for engineers working in an environment of rapidly-changing technology. 
SCOPE and Capstones A student’s final year at Olin centers on an ambitious year-long Senior 
¦ PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS




COnsulting Program for Engineering (SCOPE) project. A typical SCOPE project is undertaken by a team of four to eight students under the supervision of an Olin faculty member and serves an external partner. The SCOPE project prepares students for life and work in their chosen profession. In addition, each student undertakes a self-designed one-semester Capstone project in an area of interest within the Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, or Entrepreneurship. 
Cross Registration Most students choose to complete some degree requirements at Olin’s neighboring institutions. Cross registration agreements are in place at Wellesley, Babson, and Brandeis, enabling Olin students to benefit from other institutions’ expertise in the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and business topics. 
Self-Designed Engineering (E) Degree Concentrations Besides designated concentrations, the Engineering (E) degree offers students the opportunity to design their own concentrations, subject to review and approval by the Engineering Program Group. 
Away Experience The Olin curriculum is designed so that students who wish to spend a semester away from the College can do so. The away experience may take several forms including experience abroad or at another U.S. institution in a new cultural setting. The away experience can occur during a semester or a combination of a semester and summer. 
Research Some students choose to enhance their educational experience through participation in research activities. Olin offers many opportunities for faculty-directed undergraduate research, both during the academic year and during the summer. Students may receive either academic credit or pay for a research activity. Students are encouraged to become involved in research early in their undergraduate career, and students may participate in research as early as their first year. 
Independent Study In independent study activities, students work with faculty members to design and implement a learning and assessment plan for the study of topics not covered by listed Olin courses. 
Passionate Pursuits Students are encouraged to undertake non-degree credit activities in the form of Passionate Pursuits. These programs seek to recognize the diversity of technical, artistic, entrepreneurial, humanist, and philanthropic interests that students bring to the College. The College encourages the pursuit of such activities for both personal and professional development. Olin supports these endeavors by providing resources as well as recognition on the transcript. 


Curriculum 
The Olin College curriculum provides a strong foundation in engineering, mathematics, and applied science subjects and promotes development of engineering analysis, diagnosis, modeling, and problem-solving skills. 

Engineering 
Engineering is using technical knowledge to solve society’s problems. Every Olin graduate takes a program of studies designed to provide a superb grounding in the technical material of engineering while simultaneously connecting that material to its applications and contexts of use. From the earliest modeling and simulation activities of the Integrated Course Blocks (ICBs) and the hands-on projects of Design Nature through the project-intensive Principles of Engineering and User Oriented Collaborative Design courses, Olin students are continually putting engineering knowledge to work. 
Each Olin student also pursues a major program or concentration that is broad, deep, coherent, and rigorous in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or another area of Engineering of the student’s choice. Olin’s Engineering curriculum culminates in the Senior COnsulting Program for Engineering (SCOPE) project, in which interdisciplinary teams of students work for a full year to solve an authentic, intensive, real-world engineering problem. 



Math and Science 
Olin’s math and science curriculum serves two purposes. First, it provides students with an understanding of the deep and precise ideas that characterize science and math. Second, it teaches fundamental ideas and techniques in science and math whose application makes engineering possible. 

A student’s math and science education begins at Olin with two Integrated Course Blocks (ICBs) centered around the modeling, analysis, and control of compartment and spatially distributed systems. Math in the ICBs is focused in the first semester on differential and integral calculus in the context of elementary numerical analysis, and on vector calculus in the second semester. Science is focused on physical mechanics in the first semester and on electromagnetism and waves in the second semester. 
Olin also requires all students to complete coursework in Biology and in either Materials Science and Applied Chemistry or General Chemistry. 


Design 

Over the course of four years, students complete design projects that enable them to apply technical and non-technical knowledge and skills, develop understanding of design processes, identify and define problems, explore contextual factors that contribute to design decisions, and muster the resources necessary to realize solutions. Students undertake open-ended design problems in many courses, but design learning is emphasized and explicitly developed through a sequence of required design courses. All students complete Design Nature, User-Oriented Collaborative Design, and a further design depth course in an area of interest. 

Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences (AHS) 
Olin students study the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in order to complete their liberal arts education, develop broad knowledge of social, cultural, and humanistic contexts, and foster their ability to apply contextual thinking in the study of engineering and other disciplines. A firm foundation in AHS content, skills, and attitudes is an essential aspect of an engineering education. Students select AHS courses from offerings at Olin and neighboring institutions (Wellesley, Brandeis and Babson) in order to satisfy their individual needs and interests. All students complete a “foundation” AHS course that offers an overview of an AHS discipline, writing instruction and practice, an introduction to contextual and critical thinking, and integration of the content and perspectives of different disciplines. In addition, students complete additional AHS coursework in areas of interest. 
Each Olin student also designs a sequence of AHS or Entrepreneurship courses to provide greater depth in a single field. This sequence culminates in a student-conceived AHS or Entrepreneurship Capstone, requiring students to integrate acquired skills and knowledge. AHS Capstone experiences include research or artistic works, service projects or advanced study. 


Entrepreneurship (E!) 
Entrepreneurship is the process of identifying opportunities, fulfilling human needs, and creating value. An understanding of the knowledge, skills and behaviors required for success in entrepreneurship will position students to become better engineers and to make a positive difference in the world. To this end, Olin’s curriculum supports the learning of entrepreneurship, broadly defined. Olin graduates will demonstrate a capacity to identify social, technical, and economic opportunities, to predict challenges and costs associated with the pursuit of opportunities, and to make decisions about which opportunities are most worthy of pursuit. 
¦ PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS




Olin students are required to complete a Foundations of Business and Entrepreneurship course and the entrepreneurial components of design courses. Students have the opportunity to enroll in courses relating to business at Babson College, and interested students may design a sequence of courses to explore an entrepreneurship discipline in depth. 
Many students will also explore entrepreneurship and develop opportunity assessment abilities through their SCOPE experience and out-of-class activities such as student clubs, 

Sample Four-year Schedule

community service, and Passionate Pursuits. The Entrepreneurship experience can culminate in an Entrepreneurship Capstone, requiring students to integrate acquired skills and knowledge. 

Through a special arrangement with the Babson College Graduate School, Olin students have the opportunity for a “fast track” to a Master’s Degree in Management with a specialization in Technical Entrepreneurship. 


Communication 
Throughout the curriculum, Olin College integrates the instruction and practice of written, spoken, visual, and graphical communication. Thus, it is not only within the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences that an Olin student can expect communication-intensive course work. The Olin curriculum reflects the college’s commitment to the engineer as a highly skilled communicator. 


¦ PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS





Graduation Requirements 
Students must satisfy two classes of requirements in order to graduate from Olin: General Requirements and Program-Specific Requirements. General requirements must be satisfied by all students regardless of degree or concentration. Program-Specific Requirements vary depending on the degree being sought (ECE, ME or E) and, for the E degree, on the chosen concentration. 
General Requirements and Program-Specific Requirements are further broken down into Distribution Requirements and Course Requirements, both of which must be satisfied. 
Distribution Requirements specify the minimum total number of credits that must be completed in each of five broad areas (Engineering, Math, Science, AHS, and Entrepreneurship). 
Course requirements specify which courses must be completed. Some course requirements can only be satisfied by completing a particular course. Other course requirements allow more choice. Some courses may be used to satisfy one of several course requirements, but students must choose which course requirement such course’s completion is applied toward. 
A course completion can only satisfy one course requirement. 

General Distribution and Course Requirements 
General Distribution Requirements 
All students must complete a minimum of 120 credits appropriately distributed among five areas of study. The table below gives the minimum credits required in each area. 
Area Minimum Credits Required 
Engineering 46 
Math and Science 30 of which at least 10 must be Math 
AHS and Entrepreneurship 28 of which at least 12 must be AHS* 
A credit corresponds to an average of three hours of student work each week throughout an academic semester. Therefore, a four-credit course (the most common course size at Olin) generally requires students to spend 12 hours each week attending classes, completing homework, participating in laboratory activities, and fulfilling all other course responsibilities. 
The course catalog lists, for each course, the number of credits earned and their area. Most courses provide credit in only one area. Some courses distribute their credits across more than one area. 
Students must register for at least 12 credits but no more than 20 credits each semester. Students typically register for approximately 16 credits per semester. First-year students are limited to 18 credits in the first semester. 
Some activities, like Passionate Pursuits and a few classes, provide non-degree credit, which appears on the transcript, but does not count toward Credit Requirements. Non-degree credit counts toward the maximum credits per semester, but not toward the minimum. 
* The AHS Capstone does not count toward the 12 credit AHS minimum. 




General Course Requirements 

All Olin students, regardless of degree or concentration, must satisfy the following course requirements. The table includes one or more current classes that satisfy each requirement. 
Integrated Course Blocks (ICBs) 



Math and Science (in addition to ICBs) 



Engineering (in addition to ICBs) Design

Self-Study 

The Olin Self Study (OSS) is a four-credit self-study project in which students identify an area or question of interest, develop and follow a plan of study in pursuit of understanding important concepts in the proposed area or in pursuit of an answer to the proposed question, and write a report of the knowledge gained, applied, analyzed, synthesized, and/or evaluated through the investigation. The OSS serves to (1) develop students’ skills in working independently to learn challenging material and to tackle challenging problems; (2) develop students’ skills in independent writing; and (3) hone students’ skills and attitudes enabling life-long learning, a competency Olin considers vital for engineers working in an environment of rapidly changing technology. 
Students can satisfy the OSS requirement by completing four credits of self-study that is relevant to their SCOPE project and that is advised and evaluated by their SCOPE advisor. Students can also work under the supervision of an Olin faculty member on projects not related to SCOPE. 


Independent Study and Research 

In independent study activities, students work with faculty members to design and implement a learning and assessment plan for the study of topics not covered by listed Olin courses. 
Olin offers opportunities for undergraduate research experiences both during the academic year and during the summer. Students may receive academic credit or pay for a research activity, but not both. Independent study and research credit may be applied toward credit requirements in particular areas (Math/Science/AHS/Entrepreneurship/Engineering) and toward the overall 120 credit requirement. These activities are normally taken Pass/No Credit. In order to use independent study to satisfy a course requirement, prior approval must be obtained from the CSTB and the activity must be taken for a grade. Only in exceptional cases will research be approved to satisfy a course requirement. 
¦ PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS





Program-Specific Requirements 
Olin College offers three degrees: Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (ME), and Bachelor of Science in Engineering (E). Course Requirements for each of these degrees are outlined below. A course that is used to satisfy a General Course Requirement cannot also be used to satisfy a Program-Specific Requirement

Students who choose the Engineering degree may specify a concentration, which is a set of classes that constitute a coherent area of study. A student’s concentration appears on the diploma but not on the official transcript. The college offers designated concentrations in Bioengineering, Computing, Materials Science, and Systems. Alternatively, students may design a concentration in another area. 
Students who choose the Engineering degree must submit a concentration plan along with their declaration of major. The plan lists the courses the student intends to take to fulfill graduation requirements, and demonstrates that these courses (along with additional required courses) constitute a major in engineering that has depth, breadth, coherence, and rigor 
The concentration plan must be signed by the student’s adviser and two faculty members whose area of expertise is relevant to the proposed area of study (if the adviser’s area is relevant, the adviser can count as one of the two). 
Concentration plans are reviewed by the Engineering Program Group. This group is responsible for checking the following criteria: 
•	
Do the proposed courses constitute a major in Engineering that has breadth, depth, coherence and rigor? 

•	
Do the faculty who approved the plan have relevant expertise? Should other faculty be consulted? 

•	
Is the plan feasible based on a reasonable forecast of course offerings? The availability of faculty and other resources determines which classes we can offer and their schedule, which may limit a student’s ability to complete a particular concentration. 

•	
Is the plan comparable to the designated concentrations and previous student-designed concentrations? If a student-designed concentration is named, is the proposed name accurate and appropriate? 






The designated concentrations are examples of recommended programs, but all course plans go through the same review process. The concentration plan is provisional. If approved and completed, a student may use it to graduate. Minor substitutions may be made with adviser approval; substantive changes require approval of the Engineering Program Group. 
Engineering: Bioengineering (E:Bio) 

Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary concentration rooted in engineering, biology, and chemistry. The E:Bio concentration prepares students to approach problems important to biology, medical research, and clinical studies; it provides some of the background required for medical school. 

Bioengineering 

Students wishing to pursue the E: Bio concentration within the Engineering major must develop a specific program of study in consultation with bioengineering faculty. Below are some guidelines on course selection: 
Advanced Mathematics courses include MTH 3120 Partial Differential Equations and MTH 3170 Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos (note that both these courses have MTH 2140 Differential Equations as a prerequisite). Advanced Biology courses include SCI 2210 Immunology and SCI 3210 Human Molecular Genetics in the Age of Genomics. Bioengineering courses include all ENGR 36xx-series courses, as well as ENGR 3810 Structural Biomaterials. E:Bio course plans may include classes at Babson, Brandeis, Wellesley, or other institutions. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of acceptable courses; other courses may be used to fulfill each of these requirements if they are part of an approved course plan. 
Students interested in pursuing medical, dental or veterinary school admission should contact Dr. Janey Pratt, Olin Senior Partner in Health Science, as early in their Olin studies as possible, and ensure that their course plan meets the requirements of the programs they are considering. 
¦ PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS





Engineering: Computing (E:C) 
The Computing concentration integrates the study of computer science and software engineering within a broad interdisciplinary context. The E:C concentration offers significant flexibility, particularly with courses taken off-campus. 

Additional computing credits may include Olin courses such as ENGR 3410 Computer Architecture or advanced computer science courses at Babson, Brandeis, Wellesley, or study away institutions. ENGR 3220 Human Factors and Interaction Design may count toward the course requirements of E:C, but only if it is not used to satisfy the Design Depth requirement. 

Engineering: Materials Science (E:MS) 
Materials Science is an inherently interdisciplinary field with a strong presence throughout most engineering and science disciplines. Olin’s materials science concentration provides an integrated approach to materials, merging a variety of engineering design principles with concepts from solid-state physics and applied chemistry. Students who complete the E:MS concentration will achieve an understanding of structure-property-processing-performance relationships in materials, the ability to apply advanced scientific and engineering principles to materials systems, and the skills to synthesize appropriate technical and contextual information to solve materials selection and design problems. 

Students wishing to pursue the Materials Science concentration within the Engineering major must develop a specific program of study in consultation with materials science and applied chemistry faculty. Such programs may emphasize different aspects of materials science, such as structural materials, solid state properties of materials, processing and manufacturing, or applied chemistry. 

Engineering: Systems (E:SYS) 
The Systems concentration focuses on the design of products that integrate significant technology from multiple disciplines, with a focus on products that merge ECE and ME. Such products are particularly hard to create because designers tend to have specialized, rather than broad, knowledge of disciplines.

Course Numbering Nomenclature 
Course numbers are composed of an alphabetic prefix and a numeric suffix. The alphabetic prefix indicates the primary area of the course, according to the following table. Note that some courses earn credit for multiple areas (see Course Listings Table below). 
Alphabetic Prefix Primary Area 
AHSE AHS/Entrepreneurship 
ENGR Engineering 
MTH Mathematics 
SCI	Science 
The first digit of the numeric suffix indicates the nominal level of a course according to the following table. 
Numeric Suffix Level 
0XXX Not Applicable 
1XXX Introductory 
2XXX Intermediate 
3XXX Advanced 
4XXX Summative/Capstone/SCOPE 

Hours/Week Nomenclature 
To better allow teaching staff, facilities schedulers, and students to manage the time requirements of every course, the number of expected hours per week is indicated by a triple of numbers, as follows: 
(Contact) – (Non-Contact) – (Preparation) 
•	
Contact The first number indicates approximately the number of hours per week teaching staff and students will spend together in scheduled school facilities. 

•	
Non-Contact The second number indicates approximately the number of hours students will spend each week working on their own in scheduled school facilities. 

•	
Preparation The third number indicates approximately the number of hours per week a well-prepared student with good study habits should expect to spend studying and completing homework, reading assignments, projects, etc. 



For example, the AHSE 1100 History of Technology: A Cultural and Contextual Approach course is described as a 4-0-8 course, so students in the course can expect to spend four hours in class with an instructor, and approximately eight hours outside of class completing course-related assignments. 

Prerequisites and Co-requisites 
Prerequisites and co-requisites may occasionally be waived with permission of the course instructor.

AHSE 1130 
Seeing and Hearing: Communicating with Photographs, Video and Sound 
Instructor(s): Donis-Keller Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Usually Offered: Fall 
Seeing and Hearing is a foundation course that is about the communication of ideas developed by research, reflection, and evolving thought, using as a vehicle for expression contemporary digital media tools. In this project-based course, students will have opportunities for hands-on learning in audio recording and editing, photography and printing, and video recording and editing. Science and engineering content are integrated in order to provide a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the devices we use to gather sound and images and in order to understand more fully the properties of seeing and hearing. A major goal is to enlarge our awareness of the environment we inhabit and to respond to the perceived environment by producing original visual and sonic artwork. Students will complete projects including a self-portrait, a sound-piece that is used as an audio track for a short video, a video documentary, and a staged narrative. Our process is to share work through discussion sessions as we follow projects from their initial stages to completion and final presentation. Additional context for Seeing and Hearing is provided by selected readings, visits by guest lecturers, additional faculty and staff participation and by viewing work of other professional practitioners. This course does not require prior experience with image/sound gathering or editing. 
AHSE 1140 
Culture and Difference: An Anthropological Approach 
Instructor(s): Lynch Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Usually Offered: Fall 
This course introduces students to key concepts and methods in cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the study of how humans organize their lives as members of society, and the ways in which they make these lives meaningful. Through readings on such diverse topics as adolescence in Samoa, epilepsy among Hmong-Americans, and McDonald’s in Hong Kong, this course will explore contemporary anthropological approaches to three central questions: 1) What is culture? 2) Does “culture” explain why people do what they do and believe what they believe? 3) What fate and value do cultural differences have in today’s interconnected world? 
AHSE 1150

The Stuff of History: Materials and Culture in Ancient, Revolutionary and Contemporary Times 
Instructor(s): Martello Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Co-requisites: SCI 1410 Section 2 Usually Offered: Spring (not offered every year) 

The lion’s share of our history of technology course features a series of readings, lectures, and discussions on the relationship between materials, science, society, and the environment in three historical periods. We start with the material practices and paradigms of Copper and Bronze Age societies, shift to Paul Revere’s “Revolutionary” work with various metals and fabrication processes, and conclude with a look at the technologies and challenges of tomorrow. We will emphasize the development of three skills that are vital to our studies: contextual thinking, communication (both written and oral), and historical research methods pertaining to source evaluation and narrative construction. 
AHSE 2112 
Six Books that Changed the World 
Instructor(s): Martello Credits: 2 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Pre/Co-requisites: AHS Foundation Usually Offered: Spring (first half) 
Why and how do certain books reshape the course of human history? In this course, we will explore six books, selected from different times, societies, and genres, that have had an unquestionably major impact upon the world in which we live. Class meetings will alternate between contextual studies of the historical context of each book (including the author’s background, the political and social setting, and other factors) and careful analyses of the works themselves. Our discussions will investigate each book’s contemporary and modern impact while also exploring the qualities that caused all of our selections to have such an enduring and global effect. Students will be expected to contribute to class discussions, make presentations, and write a report on an additional book of their choosing. NOTE: this course will be offered during the first half of the spring semester, will meet twice a week, and will require approximately 12 hours of student effort each week. 
AHSE 2114 
Science Fiction and Historical Context 
Instructor(s): Martello Credits: 2 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Pre/Co-requisites: AHS Foundation Usually Offered: Spring (second half) 
Science fiction is a wonderful genre that somehow captures a society’s ideals, fears, assumptions, and major challenges. In the same way that a historian attempts to piece together complex cause-effect chains to make sense of the past, science fiction writers project the values, technologies, and beliefs of their own societies into alternate or future realities. Our class will work together to understand the conventions of science fiction and explore science fiction works (books, short stories, film) produced in different times, across various cul

Heroes for the Renaissance Engineer: Leonardo, Nabokov, Bach, Borodin 
Instructor(s): Dabby Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 3-0-9 Usually Offered: Alt Spring (odd years) 
To what extent have artists exhibited extraordinary knowledge and ability in science? Does this necessarily infuse their art, and if so, how? Source documents provide the key focus for analysis and critical thought. Artists in the fields of literature, art, and music include Vladimir Nabokov (writer and lepidopterist), Leonardo da Vinci (artist and engineer), Alexander Borodin (composer and chemist), and J. S. Bach (composer, performer, and acoustician). Each of these achieved a self-sufficiency enabling the articulation and realization of work that reveals a singular vision, shaped in part by fluency in both technical and artistic disciplines. Class trips to concerts and museums in Boston and New York enable students to explore firsthand the works of these individuals. Students also have the opportunity to realize projects that meld the arts and sciences in order to experience firsthand the satisfaction and challenges faced by Bach, Borodin, Nabokov, and Leonardo in their desire for knowledge, discovery, and creative expression.  
AHSE 2130 
The Intersection of Art and Science 
Instructor(s): Donis-Keller Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Usually Offered: Alt Fall (even years) 
Science and Art are often considered entirely different worlds inhabited by practitioners who have nothing in common. In this course, we will debunk this myth by closely examining the discovery process in both disciplines and by comparing the culture of science to that of art, historically and in the present. We will consider the influence of scientific discoveries, from optics to “new media” on the production of art and discuss the corollary question “Has art influenced the progress of science?” We will also consider ways in which science allows us to understand artists and the work they create. In contemporary society, artists have begun to comment on science, sometimes with disastrous results, which leads us to ask, “What is needed in order to establish a meaningful dialogue between scientists and artists, and, does it matter?” 
AHSE 2131 
Responsive Drawing and Visual Thinking 
Instructor(s): Donis-Keller Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Usually Offered: Fall 
The course assumes no prior experience in drawing. Students will learn to visualize objects in three-dimensional space and commit them to the two-dimensional space of a page, gaining critical experience with “idea sketching,” an ability that can be put to many uses in future courses (e.g. project design). Students will also draw subjects from life, i.e. stationary objects and life models using media including charcoal, graphite, conté, and ink. The emphasis will be realistic depiction as compared to non-objective abstraction. Students will begin with basic exercises in drawing and rapidly move to more complex intensive drawing experiences. Approximately one-third of the classroom time will be used for drawing from a life model. Class discussion and sketchbook homework assignments will be an essential element in the learning process. Homework assignments will include drawing and visual thinking exercises to be completed in personal sketchbooks. Reading selected text material is also part of the homework requirement. Several invited speakers will contribute to the course and provide informal critiques of student work. One field trip is planned to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge to view art. Other in-class activities will include participation in discussion of drawings (old master and contemporary) that are presented to illustrate various objectives of classroom work (e.g. use of line to indicate form) and group critique sessions. Assessment will be based on weekly homework assignments, classroom work, and three drawing projects to be completed outside of class. 


AHSE 2140 
Anthropology: Culture, Knowledge and Creativity 
Instructor(s): Lynch Credits: 4 AHS Hours: 4-0-8 Prerequisites: AHS Foundation Usually Offered: Spring 

Anthropological theories and methods help us understand human behavior and values. Broadly speaking, anthropologists ask, “Why do people do what they do and believe what they believe?” Today, anthropologists study a wide range of contemporary social issues, such as international development, garment manufacturing, the production of scientific knowledge, female “circumcision,” and intellectual property. In this course, we will read about, debate, and discuss these and other issues in order to probe into the meanings of culture, knowledge, and creativity. 
•	
What do anthropologists mean by 
culture?


•	
What does it mean to take cultural difference seriously? 

•	
Does culture have an influence on what is considered legitimate “knowledge”? 


•	
If knowledge is “situated,” what happens when one form of knowledge comes in contact with another (for instance in discussions of global human rights)? 

•	
What is the relationship between cultural difference, situated knowledge, and human creativity? 

•	
Does globalization threaten to destroy creativity, stifle innovation, and erase difference? 


After we learn how anthropologists deal with these questions at a range of research sites, we will end the course with our own anthropological studies that utilize what we have learned earlier in the course. Students will conduct short research projects that examine social issues pertaining to the use of the Internet in the United States. By ending with a study of ourselves, students will see how creative we really are; that we, too, have culture; and that what we consider legitimate knowledge is culturally situated. The professor will assume no prior knowledge of anthropology. Skills to be developed include critical reading, critical thinking, writing and analysis, presenting arguments in oral and visual form, and working on projects in small groups. The following texts will be used, among others: Jean Davison, Voices from Mutira: Change in the Lives of Gikuyu Women, Daniel Miller and Don Slater, The Internet: An Ethnographic Approach, Jeremy MacClancy, Exotic No More: Anthropology on the Front Lines.

Please contact the AHS Committee at ahs@lists.olin.edu with any questions. 
AHSE 4590 
Entrepreneurship Capstone 
Instructor(s): Bourne, Schiffman Credits: 4 AHSE Hours: 2-0-10 Prerequisites: Permission of the Instructor(s) Usually Offered: Fall, Spring 
The Entrepreneurship Capstone is an advanced, self-designed project that builds upon a student’s prior experience in business and entrepreneurship. All students must complete either an AHS Capstone or an Entrepreneurship Capstone in order to graduate. Entrepreneurship Capstones must be proposed to the Entrepreneurship Committee and approved by the end of the academic year prior to the Capstone except in extenuating circumstances. Normally, an Entrepreneurship Capstone student will engage in a team or individual project to build and/or execute a plan to bring a new organization, product or service into being. For this reason, a course on Entrepreneurship and New Ventures is normally expected as a prerequisite to enrolling in the Entrepreneurship Capstone. Courses that satisfy this prerequisite include Babson’s EPS3501 or EPS3501T and Olin’s AHSE 3599 Special Topics in Business and Entrepreneurship: Technology and New Ventures. If you are planning to enroll in the Entrepreneurship Capstone, and have not yet completed this prerequisite, it is strongly suggested you enroll in AHSE 3599. Class sessions for the Entrepreneurship Capstone will consist of seminar-style “plenary” sessions as well as other pedagogical modalities as appropriate. If choosing the Entrepreneurship Capstone track, a student must also complete 8 additional depth credits in business or entrepreneurship. 
The New Ventures course counts for 4 of those credits. Please contact Steve Schiffman with any questions.

In this course, we will look at life as one of the many phenomena displayed by the universe in its evolution, and apply the laws of physics to understand these phenomena. In doing so, we will take a “reductionist” or simplified approach to investigate the big picture; i.e., we will explore basic biophysical mechanisms that make various living organisms and biological assemblies interesting to scientists and useful for engineers. We will aim to achieve an intuitive and a semi-quantitative understanding of physical phenomena ranging from electrosensing (the ability of some animals to sense external electric fields for navigation and the detection of prey and communication) and obesity to biomechanics of athlete performance and scaling theory, which provides us with information about beasts we have never seen, for example, dinosaurs. Based on physical laws, we will examine diseases ranging from the cataract of the eye to the formation of gallstones in gall bladder bile. In order to gain knowledge of these various phenomena, we will systematically investigate the properties of water, Brownian motion, dynamics and physiology of fluids, thermodynamics, biomechanics and bioenergetics, and the electrochemical potential. Although engineers spend their entire careers solving and optimizing various problems, nature has been doing this for much longer; therefore, a deep understanding of biophysical processes in nature can yield unforeseen solutions to countless scientific and engineering problems. In this course, we will learn how to learn from nature.

Topics include structure and bonding in organic compounds; chemical and physical properties of organic molecules and bulk organic materials; reaction mechanisms and kinetics; structure-reactivity relationships; chemical and physical transformations; synthesis of organic molecules; and characterization techniques. It is strongly suggested that students who intend to take SCI 2320 first take Introduction to Chemistry, or an equivalent college level course. 
SCI 3120 
Solid State Physics 
Instructor(s): Christianson Credits: 4 SCI Hours: 4-0-8 Prerequisite: SCI 2130 Usually Offered: Alt Spring (odd-years) 
Why do metals conduct heat well while insulators do not? Why is silicon a better semiconductor than diamond, even though they have the same structure? Why is lead a good superconductor at low temperature, while copper is not? We will explore the current understanding of insulators, metals, semiconductors and superconductors through some of the basic tools of solid state physics, and will learn how to apply these tools to the novel materials being developed today.

Advanced Classical Mechanics 
Instructor(s): Zastavker Credits: 4 SCI Hours: 4-0-8 Prerequisite: ICB2, MTH 2120, MTH 2140 Usually Offered: Alt Fall (even years) 
Classical mechanics revisited with the use of mathematical formulation that makes the “old and dusty” Newton’s laws shine in all their beauty. Using differential equations and linear algebra tools, we will venture to look at things only hinted at in introductory physics: variational principles, the two-body problem, motion in accelerated frames, rigid body dynamics, oscillations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, continuum mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos. 

SCI 3210 
Molecular Genetics in the Age of Genomics 
Instructor(s): Donis-Keller Credits: 4 SCI Hours: 4-0-8 Prerequisites: SCI1210 (Olin); BISC219 (Wellesley); or Permission of the Instructor(s) Usually Offered: Fall 
It is now understood that many, if not the majority, of human disorders, including cancers, have an underlying genetic component. In this modern age of healthcare, we are expected to choose amongst an array of therapeutic options for ourselves and for our children rather than respond to specific directives from the medical establishment. In addition, we are called upon as voting citizens to make ethical decisions, e.g. the appropriateness of stem cell cloning. Therefore, it is in the interest of each person to learn more than the fundamentals of biology and genetics in order to make educated choices. In this course we will be concerned with the traditional concepts of human genetics including pedigree analysis, linkage mapping, Mendelian, multi-locus and complex traits, and genetic testing. However, for the most part, the course will view human genetics through a molecular lens. For example, the molecular basis of pathological conditions such as Huntington’s disease, hypercholesterolemia, Fragile-X and others will be examined in detail, as will gene imprinting and imprinting-related abnormalities (e.g. Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes). Comparative genomics will be applied to the study of heritable traits in humans. The structure, function, and evolution of the sex chromosomes will also receive special attention. Gene therapy, cloning (stem cell, germ line) and the associated ethical issues will be considered in some depth. Students who are interested in bioengineering or medical school should find this course useful as well as those who have a general interest in the human as an organism. 

Academic Policies






Academic Policies 
One of Olin’s highest priorities is the well being of its students, and Olin recognizes that individual circumstances often call for individual approaches. Olin’s faculty, staff, and administration will always attempt to do what is right, regardless of the formal rule. The following policies will help to ensure that students are treated fairly. 
Attendance Policy 
Students are expected to attend all classes at Olin. Each instructor will establish and publish the class attendance policies for reporting anticipated absences and making up missed work, including lab experiences and project work. The Dean of Student Life will grant exceptions for illness, religious observance, or other reasons deemed appropriate. 

Olin Exposition 
The Olin Exposition is a public event at the end of each semester where students present academic and non-academic work to an audience that includes the entire Olin community and external visitors. It is an opportunity for students to reflect on the semester, celebrate their achievements and share them with others, practice communication skills, and demonstrate their activities and abilities. Expo is an opportunity for people outside the college to see what Olin students can do, and it is an important way of involving external constituencies in the activities of the school. Faculty, staff, students and external visitors are asked to evaluate student presentations as a way of helping students improve and also as a way of evaluating our programs. 
Normally all registered students are required to participate in Expo, both as presenters and as evaluators. Students who cannot attend Expo for any reason should petition the Dean of Student Life as early as possible for an excused absence. Failure to participate in Expo is noted by the faculty Expo Coordinator. Persistent failure to participate without an excused absence may be considered a violation of the Honor Code, particularly regarding Passion for the Welfare of the College. 

Definition of Full-Time Status 
Enrollment at Olin College is for full-time study in engineering. Students are expected to follow the curriculum design for each class year and carry a usual load of 16 degree credits. The definition of full-time study is a minimum of 12 attempted degree credits each semester and a maximum of 20 attempted degree credits each semester. Part-time study is generally not available at Olin College; however, special cases will be considered by the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising. 

Course Overload Policy 
Olin students may register for a maximum of 20 credits each semester. The maximum load of 20 credits is a total of degree and non-degree activities. In exceptional circumstances, students may petition the Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP), with the consent of their adviser, for approval of a course overload. This reflects Olin’s commitment to reasonable expectations. Non-degree credits result from Passionate Pursuits. First-year, first-semester students are limited to taking a maximum of 18 credits. This typically represents sixteen credits of standard first-year curriculum and an optional two credit Introductory Programming course. 

Class Standing 
Class standing is determined by the number of degree credits a student has earned in relation to the 120 required for graduation. The following table is a breakdown of earned degree credits and their corresponding class year and represents a reasonable expectation of progress toward a degree over four years. 


Class  Earned Degree Credits  
First-Year  0–30  
Sophomore  31–60  
Junior  61–90  
Senior  > 90  



Declaration of Major/Change of Major 

Students are expected to declare their major no later than the time of registration for the fourth semester. Major declaration forms are available at the Student Accounts and Records Center (StAR) website (http://star.olin.edu) and must be signed by the student and his or her adviser. Students declaring the Engineering major must also complete and submit a course plan form at the same time. The instructions and form can also be found on the StAR website. 
Change of majors can be submitted using a declaration of major form and a course plan form (if appropriate). Students that change their major should be aware of their remaining degree requirements. Additionally, they are responsible for tuition, room/board and fees for any semesters beyond the eight covered by the Olin scholarship. 

Registration 

Prior to each semester, there will be a designated registration period in which students will speak with their adviser and make choices for course selection. Registration is done on-line. Instructions are available each semester in the published registration booklets. 

Cross-Registration Policy 
Olin has cross-registration agreements with Babson College, Brandeis University, and Wellesley College (the BBW schools). These agreements increase the academic offerings available to Olin students in the natural and mathematical sciences, arts, humanities, social sciences and business. Olin students, with the exception of first-semester, first-year students, are permitted to enroll for one course each semester at each of the BBW schools, subject to the continuation of the cross-registration agreements. Taking a course at a BBW school will count toward a student’s total degree credit load at Olin. Normally, Olin students are not permitted to take courses at BBW schools which would substantially duplicate the content of a course or set of courses available at Olin, but may petition the Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) for an exception to this rule. With prior approval from the CSTB, students may use courses taken at the BBW schools to satisfy general course requirements, distribution requirements, and program-specific course requirements. 
Students are responsible for all deadlines and registration procedures related to the host school. Information regarding procedures for cross-registration is provided in the semesters’ registration booklet. Note: Due to the variation of grading deadlines at BBW schools, seniors are strongly encouraged not to cross-register during their final semester at Olin. 

The Add Period 
During the first 10 instructional days of a semester, a student may alter her or his schedule by adding and/or dropping courses with approval from her or his adviser and the appropriate instructing faculty. Requests for changes must be made during the 10-day period. Students are responsible for submitting their request electronically or in person at the Student Accounts and Records Center no later than the 10th class day. Courses cannot be added after the 10th class day. Special circumstances may be granted for BBW-sponsored courses when there is a variation in the academic calendars. 


The Drop Period 
After the Add Period, a student may decide to drop a course from his or her schedule without 
¦ ACADEMIC POLICIES




penalty as long as he or she maintains a minimum of 12 degree credits. The drop date is the 45th instructional day of the semester 

Course Withdrawal 
Students may not withdraw from courses within the Integrated Course Blocks during their first year at Olin. Students may withdraw from other courses up through the last day of instruction in the semester. To withdraw from a course, students need written approval from her or his adviser and the appropriate instructing faculty. Students must then process the course withdrawal at the Student Accounts and Records Center. A grade of Withdrawn (W) will be entered for the course and will not affect the grade point average. Credits attempted will be noted, but course credit will not be earned. Students are responsible for meeting with their adviser to determine how the credits, and/or requirement will be completed in the future. 
Olin students cross-registered at one of the BBW schools must follow the academic policy on course withdrawals for the host school. 

Half-Semester Courses 
The Add, Drop and Course Withdrawal periods are prorated for half semester courses. The Add Period is the first five days of the semester. The Drop Period is 10 days prior to the last day of instruction. Course withdrawals can be done up through the last instructional day of the half-semester course. 

Grading at Olin 
Philosophy 
Standards-based Grading: Course grading at Olin will be based on student progress toward defined course goals. Summary metrics (e.g., GPA) will be provided on the student’s transcript, but relative summary metrics (e.g., class rank) are neither published nor tabulated. The Dean of Faculty will annually conduct a review of grade distributions and grading procedures. 
Grading Rules and Regulations 
1. 
Privacy: Olin will not publicly post either grades or summary metrics (e.g., GPAs) in any form that allows identification of any particular individual’s performance. It is expected that students will respect the privacy of each other’s grades. 

2. 
Grading Clarity Requirements: On the first day of instruction, each Olin class will publish the following information: 

a. 
Learning Objectives that specify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that students are expected to develop or attain in the class. The learning objectives should be an effective instrument for students to understand what they will learn and how their learning will be evaluated. 

b. 
Grading Criteria that specify how the final course grade is determined. Some aspects of grading are necessarily based on the professional judgment of instructors, informed by their experience, and are subjective. 



3. 
Feedback: Olin expects instructors to provide students with feedback on their performance. If an instructor feels a student will not pass a course, or if the instructor is otherwise concerned about a student’s performance, she or he will issue an academic deficiency notice in a timely manner. Copies of this notice will be sent to the student, the student’s faculty adviser, and the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising. 

4. 
End of Semester Feedback to the Adviser: Olin advisers have real-time access to advisee’s course grades through the Student Information System. In addition, instructors will notify advisers of any significant concerns noted during the semester. 

5. 
Pass/No Record First Semester: In the first-semester, first-year, Olin instructors may report the student’s grade to the student and to the adviser, but will report only a grade of Pass (P) or No Record (NR) to the Registrar. A grade of No Record does not affect the student’s GPA. In 




subsequent semesters, Olin instructors will report the student’s final course grade, according to the scale outlined below, to the Registrar. 
6. 
Course Grades: Course grades at Olin provide students, their advisers, potential employers and graduate schools information about overall performance. Course grades are determined based upon a mix of demonstrated comprehension, skill, participation, and effort. 

7. 
Grading Scale: The Olin College grading scheme contains letter grades with a resulting grade point average (GPA) on a four-point scale. Students will be assessed using the following interpretation: 


Grade  Assessment  Point  
Description  Value  
A  Excellent  4.0  
A 3.7  
B+  3.3  
B  Good  3.0  
B 2.7  
C+  2.3  
C  Fair  2.0  
C 1.7  
D+  1.3  
D  Poor  1.0  
F  Failing  0.0  
I  Incomplete (temporary grade)  n/a  
IF  Incomplete Failing  0.0  
IL  Incomplete / Leave of Absence  
(temporary grade)  n/a  
IP  In Progress (temporary grade)  
L/NR  Leave/No Record  n/a  
NC  No Credit for Pass/No Credit Option  n/a  
NR  No Record  n/a  
P  Pass  n/a  
R  Course Repeated  n/a  
TR  Transfer Credit  n/a  
W  Withdrew from Course  n/a  

8. 
Grade Replacement: If a student successfully achieves remediation of an eligible course (see Remediation in the ICBs), the course grade will be changed. The grade given as a result of remediation activities may be a Pass (P) for a first-year, first-semester course remediation or no higher than a C for other course remediation. 

9. 
Repeated Courses: If a student retakes a course as part of remediation, the original attempted course will show a grade of Course Repeated (R). If a student retakes a course that is not part of remediation, the original grade will remain, but will not be factored into the student’s GPA. In both scenarios, the new grade or transfer credit will appear on the transcript in the semester in which the course was retaken. 

10.
 Minimally Sufficient Grades: A grade of D or Pass is sufficient to earn credit for a course. 


A grade of D is sufficient to satisfy a course requirement. 
A grade of C- or Pass is sufficient to satisfy a prerequisite requirement. 
11.
 Pass/No Credit: Up to 12 credits of a student’s distribution requirements may be satisfied by taking classes that are usually offered for grades as Pass/No Credit. In such cases, a Pass is given for performance equivalent to a grade of C- or higher. Courses taken Pass/No Credit may not be used to meet course requirements unless the course is not offered for grades (e.g. first-semester first-year P/NR courses). 

Courses that are only offered Pass/No Credit, Independent Study and Research do not count toward the 12 credit limit. Students must declare their Pass/No Credit grading option by the drop date of each semester. The Pass/No Credit option does not impact the GPA; either Pass or No Credit will appear on the transcript. Once a student decides to take a course Pass/No Credit, he or she cannot revert back to receive a letter grade. 

12.
 Passionate Pursuits (including Research as Passionate Pursuit): Passionate Pursuits are non-degree credit, and will be listed on the transcript if the nature of the activity and the 


¦ ACADEMIC POLICIES




level of completion are sufficient to merit credit. In exceptional cases, the faculty supervisor may include an official letter of commendation in the student’s file. This commendation letter will be available to external parties. 
13. The Olin Transcript: A student’s academic transcript at Olin includes the following information: 
a. 
A list of classes the student took in each semester, and a record of the student’s final grades in those classes. First-semester first-year transcripts will show only classes that were passed. Classes taken Pass/No Credit after the first year appear either as a Pass or as a No Credit 

b. 
The student’s GPA. 

c. 
A list of non-degree activities taken each semester with a cumulative total of credits earned. There are no grades associated with non-degree activities. 

d. 
Co-Curricular offerings in which the sponsoring staff or faculty member reported sufficient student participation for a transcript notation. 



4. Grading and Credits of Cross-registered Courses: Olin students who take a course at Babson, Brandeis, or Wellesley (the BBW schools) will receive credit for the course if they receive a passing grade. The grade will be recorded on their transcript and be factored into their grade point average. Credits from these schools will be counted on a one for one basis at Olin. For example, if a three credit course is taken at Babson, it will count as three Olin credits. A one unit Brandeis or Wellesley course is equal to four Olin credits. Courses that use other accounting schemes may be translated into equivalent Olin credits rounded to the closest whole number. 


Honor Code 
It is expected that students will behave with integrity and according to the Honor Code. 

Incomplete Policy 
In extenuating circumstances, a student may request an Incomplete (I) grade by petitioning the Dean of Student Life. If an Incomplete grade is approved, the student will be granted an extension period to complete the coursework. The length of the extension will be determined by the Dean of Student Life but will not end later than the end of the subsequent semester. A grade of I will be listed as a temporary grade and will not affect the grade point average. If the work is not completed by the end of the subsequent semester, the incomplete grade of I will be changed to IF, Incomplete Failing, or an alternate grade upon approval of the instructor and the Dean of Faculty. An IF grade does affect a grade point average. Incompletes may not be used for remediation purposes. 
An Incomplete is generally approved only when some specific event or illness prevents the student from completing a specific part of the course (such as completing a paper, project or exam.) An Incomplete will not be approved in instances where a student is demonstrating an overall difficulty covering or understanding the course materials and appears to need more time or additional instruction to learn the material. If such general difficulty occurs in one of the first-year ICB courses, the student should attempt to complete the course. If the student receives a NR in the first semester or a D+ or below in subsequent semesters, he or she will proceed according to the remediation policy (see below). For all other courses, the student should discuss available options with his or her course instructor and adviser. 

Extra Help 
For all courses, faculty members provide extra help for students as appropriate. In addition, individual tutors are assigned by the Office of Student Life. Students who feel that individual tutoring would be helpful to them should contact the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising as early in the semester as the need becomes apparent. 



Remediation in the ICBs 
For Integrated Course Block (ICB) courses in the first year, Olin provides a remediation system. The objective of remediation is to allow students to keep pace academically with their peers in the first year. 

As the need becomes apparent, ICB faculty members work with students to develop a remediation policy specific to the courses they are teaching. At the discretion of the faculty member, students may be allowed to retake a test, rewrite a paper, or redo other projects or assignments. Students may get remedial assistance from faculty, peer tutors or individual tutors. 
The ICB is a graduation requirement so a grade of NR or F must be remediated. In addition, the ICB courses are prerequisites for many other courses at Olin, so a grade of D or D+ must be remediated, although a student may be allowed to go on while remediation is pending. 
There are three ways a student can remediate: 

Remediation exam: A student may study independently and pass a written or oral remediation exam. The student may attempt this exam only once, either at the beginning or the end of the semester following the original course period. The remediation exam will be prepared and evaluated by the original faculty member who taught the student’s Physics, Math or Engineering component of the ICB. Assistance in preparing for the exam is available from designated peer tutors for Physics, Math and Engineering. 
Remediation at another institution: With prior approval of the Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB), students may remediate by taking a class at another institution (but not at one of the BBW schools). The CSTB will work with the Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) to determine the grade required for remediation at another institution. 
Retake the course: If a student does not successfully remediate the course before it is next offered, the student will be required to retake and pass the failed component(s) of the ICB at its subsequent offering. 
Students successfully remediating through one of these three options will have their original grade replaced on their transcript. For letter graded courses, the remediated grade can be no higher than a C. 


Grade Change Policy 
Dispute of a Grade 
Students wishing to dispute a grade should first have a discussion with the instructing faculty member. If the student and faculty are in disagreement after the discussion, the student may appeal to the Dean of Faculty. The Dean of Faculty will meet with the student within 14 days of the appeal and will solicit a statement from the faculty member. Following this process, the Dean of Faculty will review the case and submit a recommendation to the faculty member. The faculty member will then make a final decision, in consultation with the Dean of Faculty. 
After one calendar year (from the end of the original grading period), all grades are final. This applies to clerical errors, grade disputes, remediation, and the grade replacement policy. 
All grade changes must be made in writing and signed by the Dean of Faculty. 



Final Exam Policy for Excused Absences 
Students who are unable to take their final exams for legitimate reasons and wish to request a make-up exam generally must obtain advance authorization from the instructing faculty members and the Office of Student Life. In the event that advanced authorization cannot be obtained due to extenuating circumstances, students should contact the Office of Student Life and the instructor(s) as soon as they are able. If the exam is not completed prior to the end of the grading period, a grade of Incomplete, I, will be recorded on the student record. An incomplete grade is a temporary grade that does not affect a grade point average. 
¦ ACADEMIC POLICIES





Academic Recommendation Board 
The Academic Recommendation Board (ARB) has the responsibility to foster change and act as a steward of the curriculum. The ARB regularly reviews the curricular structure and course options and reviews and authorizes changes in degree requirements. Students may petition ARB if they need to apply for an exception to graduation requirements. 

Course Substitution and Transfer Board 
The Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) is a subcommittee of the ARB and has the responsibility of awarding Olin credit for classes taken at another institution. There are three cases where a student can take a class at another institution and get credit toward an Olin degree: cross-registration at Babson, Brandeis or Wellesley, classes taken during a Study Away experience, and classes taken at another institution during the summer, during a leave from Olin, or before enrolling at Olin. The CSTB also determines what distribution and course requirements a non-Olin course can count for. Many courses at the BBW schools have been pre-approved; a list of these courses is posted on the ARB website (http://arb.olin.edu). Prior to taking a non-Olin class not on the pre-approval list, students should request permission from the CSTB to count this class toward satisfying a distribution or course requirement. 

Committee on Student Academic Performance 
The Committee on Student Academic Performance is charged by the Dean of Student Life and is empowered to review, interpret, and propose academic performance policies. This committee considers petitions to waive existing academic performance regulations and acts as an appellate body for students with academic performance grievances. The committee also examines the records of students who are not making satisfactory progress toward a degree. 
This committee is chaired by the Dean of Student Life or the Dean’s designee (non-voting, except in the case of a tie) and consists of the Registrar (non-voting), the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising, and three faculty members. Students wishing to appeal a decision on policy must submit their appeal to the Registrar within one week of the original decision. 
Students should petition COSAP if they want to exceed the approved maximum credits in any given semester. 

Student Academic Performance 
The Committee on Student Academic Performance uses the following guidelines in determining the academic status of students. Students not in Good Academic Standing will be placed on probation. Students not in Good Academic Standing for two consecutive semesters will be reviewed by the committee and may be required to withdraw. The committee may consider extenuating circumstances in applying these general guidelines. 
Qualitative Measure of Academic Performance: 
Student’s First Semester: Good Academic Standing is defined as receiving Pass grades in all courses by the start of the second semester. 
Subsequent Semesters: Good Academic Standing is defined as having a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 by the end of the semester. 
Quantitative Measure of Academic Performance: 
In order to complete the degree in four years (eight semesters), each student will normally take 16 credits (four courses) per semester. Olin College expects students to make reasonable progress toward their degree each semester. As a result, to remain in good standing a student must complete a minimum of 12 degree credits each semester. The Committee on Student Academic Performance will review this quantitative measure in addition to the qualitative measure of a minimum grade point average. 


Academic Readmission 

In making decisions on readmission petitions, the Committee on Student Academic Performance (COSAP) will expect the former student to produce timely evidence of good academic performance in college courses comparable to Olin courses, employment and/or community service references, and a formal statement explaining changes that will contribute to their academic success at Olin. Credit for courses taken elsewhere while a student is withdrawn from Olin will be transferable to Olin only if approval is obtained from the CSTB prior to enrollment in each course. 
Program Group Recommendations 

The Program Groups (ECE, ME, E) will periodically review the progress of every student with a declared major. The program groups will work with students and their faculty adviser if performance in program-specific course requirements is unsatisfactory or if trends indicate that such performance may become unsatisfactory. 

College Withdrawal Policy 

Students may wish to leave Olin College prior to completing their degree. Such a decision may be difficult to make. Therefore, we encourage students to discuss the situation with their faculty adviser and the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising. A student should consider whether a Leave of Absence might provide a more suitable means for them to address the underlying circumstances for the withdrawal. The student’s decision to withdraw indicates she or he does not intend to return. If a student needs a leave of absence, she or he should follow the procedures described below for requesting a leave. Dropping all registered courses does not automatically result in an official withdrawal from the college. 
Voluntary Withdrawal 

A student can voluntarily withdraw from Olin College. The student must file a College Withdrawal Form with the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising. Withdrawing for nonmedical reasons during a semester will yield grades of W, Withdrew, on the student’s academic record. If Voluntary Withdrawal occurs after the last instructional day of the semester, grades from that semester will appear on the transcript. 
Medical Withdrawal 
Students who need to withdraw from Olin College for medical reasons should complete a College Withdrawal Form with the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising. If a student intends to return to the College, he or she should follow the procedure outlined in the Leave of Absence policy. Medical Withdrawals during a semester (i.e., by the last instructional day of a semester) will result in deletion of the semester’s registration from the student’s record. Students may be entitled in these circumstances to a full or partial refund of certain expenses and fees according to the guidelines of the College’s refund policy. Medical documentation may be required to complete the process. 
Required Withdrawal 
At times, the college may require a student to withdraw from Olin College for academic or other reasons. Students who are required to withdraw may not reenroll at Olin without approval from the Office of Student Life. 


Leave of Absence Policy 
A student may request a leave of absence for up to 180 days in any 12-month period. 
To initiate a leave of absence, a student should meet with his or her adviser and complete a Leave of Absence Form. The request is then forwarded to the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising for approval. Documentation of the reason for the leave of absence (medical or otherwise) should accompany the student’s request for a leave. The request, when approved, and any accompanying documentation will be forwarded to the Registrar for processing and placed in the student’s academic file. 
In the event a Leave of Absence is approved, the student’s status will be noted as “On Leave.” If a leave is not approved, students 
¦ ACADEMIC POLICIES




have the right to appeal the decision to the Dean of Student Life within two weeks of the date of the denial of leave. There are two kinds of leaves: 
1. A Leave of Absence Mid Semester: This type of leave is requested when a semester is in active session*. In this case, all courses for which the student is registered will be temporarily designated as Incomplete/Leave of Absence (IL). Any course that is not subsequently completed will then be changed to a grade of Leave/No Record (L/NR) and will be recorded internally for that course. Incomplete/Leave of Absence and Leave/No Record grades do not affect the student’s grade point average. The effective date of this leave is the approval date of the leave. 
Incomplete/Leave of Absence grades must be completed no later than 90 days after the student’s return date, or at another date determined by the faculty member and adviser. 
2. A Leave of Absence Between Semesters: 
This type of leave is requested when a semester is not in active session and there is a circumstance that impacts the student’s ability to continue in the next semester. In this type of leave, there are no grade entries made. The student’s schedule for the ensuing semester will be deleted. The student will be placed on leave effective the first day of the upcoming semester for up to 180 days in any 12-month period. 
If a student does not return from a leave of absence, the student will be withdrawn from the college as of the date of expected return. All Incomplete/Leave of Absence grades will be changed to Leave/No Record. 
Return from Leave or Withdrawal 
Students wishing to return from a leave of absence or voluntary withdrawal, leave of absence or medical withdrawal from the college should contact the Office of Student Life. 
* This active session does not include the study or final exam period. If a student has an unexpected event that impacts his or her ability to take a final exam, he or she should refer to the Final Exam Policy for Excused Absences. 

Study Away Program 
One of the founding principles of Olin College was that each student should have the opportunity to have a learning experience “away” from the College. This ideal was articulated early in the creation of the college with the expressed objective of having students learn to be citizens of the world. The Olin Away Program was created to deliver on this principle, and provide students with the opportunity to broaden their perspective and views of the world. 
Students in their junior year can choose between three types of away experiences: a Direct Exchange Program, a Pre-Approved Program, or a Student-Designed Program. 
For additional information please visit: http://awayprograms.olin.edu 

Transfer Credit 
Olin College generally does not accept transfer credit for incoming students, but the Course Substitution and Transfer Board (CSTB) may grant exceptions on a case by case basis for incoming students who have demonstrated strong performance in rigorous courses taken at accredited institutions. 
Enrolled students wishing to take a course at another college and transfer the credits to Olin must obtain prior approval from the CSTB. A student will need to provide detailed information about the course including, but not limited to, a course description and syllabus. Pre-approval forms can be found at: http://star.olin.edu 
The CSTB will ask appropriate faculty to review the course materials before granting approval and determine the minimum grade standard for transfer of the specific course. If approved, the CSTB will notify the student in writing. Once the course is completed, it is the student’s responsibility to have an official transcript sent to Olin College. Provided the student meets the minimum grade requirement for transfer, the course and the credits will appear on the student’s Olin transcript. The grade does not transfer. The Olin College curriculum is for eight full semesters. Transfer credit does not imply that a student is able to finish his or her degree in less than eight semesters. 


In order to receive a degree from Olin, students must earn at least 60 of their credits from Olin or BBW courses. 

AP Exams and Advanced Study 

Olin College does not accept AP Exam credit for incoming students. Olin College does, however, recognize that many students enter Olin with a strong background in mathematics and physics. First-year students may take a placement exam in the subjects of the first-year mathematics or physics courses during orientation. Placement exams at Olin are calibrated to a high standard. 

Special Accommodations Policy 

It is Olin College’s policy to comply fully with all state and federal disability laws. Olin does not discriminate against applicants or students with disabilities, and will consider modification to academic programs where necessary to ensure that our requirements are not discriminatory, as long as the modifications do not fundamentally alter the nature of our programs. The Office of Student Life coordinates services for students with learning disabilities, sensory impairments, psychological disabilities, and medical conditions. Students are responsible for identifying themselves to the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising and providing appropriate documentation of their disability and need for accommodation in a timely manner. Students requesting accommodation should contact the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising as soon as possible after matriculation. Services for students with learning disabilities may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, coaching on organizational and time management skills, faculty notification, and academic advising. Services for students with physical, sensory, or psychological impairments as well as medical conditions may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, assistance with adaptive technology, accessibility accommodations, and academic advising. Any specific modifications granted will be based on detailed discussions with each student about their particular situation, and on information from a medical care provider concerning the student’s disability and related needs.

Student Life




Student Life 
Overview 
The first few classes at Olin College have the rare ability to help create the campus culture. Each student has the chance to make a real impact on the direction of programs, available opportunities and the overall atmosphere of the new college. 
While still new, Olin already offers the support, flexibility and services students need for a successful, well-rounded college career — from a wide-range of clubs and activities to academic advising and health services. 
The Office of Student Life also takes student development one step further with the Olin College Learning Continuum. While nearly every college in America offers academic courses and student organizations, seldom is much thought given to the unstructured zone between the curriculum and extra-curriculum, or the connections between them. At Olin, we have given this zone a lot of thought. 
The Olin College Learning Continuum consists of courses, undergraduate research opportunities with faculty, non-degree credit Passionate Pursuits, transcript noted co-curricular offerings, community service, committee work or other service to the college, clubs and organizations, and recreation. The Office of Student Life staff encourages student participation along the full range of opportunities in the Learning Continuum and works to foster connections among the elements on the continuum. 




Honor Code 

A fundamental element of Olin’s culture is trust. As such, our Honor Code requires all members of the Olin community to conduct themselves with honor and integrity. The code, drawn from a few core values, consists of a small set of intentionally broad standards by which every action must be measured. While a small number of policies illuminate Olin’s principles, students live by the core values embedded in the code. To read the full code, visit the student life page of the Olin website, http://www.olin.edu/student_life/. 

Passionate Pursuits 

A Passionate Pursuit is an activity in which students propose a semester-long project, solicit faculty participation, and establish objectives 
(i.e. learning goals, type of deliverable) that constitute satisfactory completion of the pursuit. In order to earn non-degree credit for a Passionate Pursuit, students must submit a credit proposal and give a faculty-assessed presentation or performance at the conclusion of the activity. Funding is available via the Office of Student Life. 


Co-Curriculars 

Co-curricular offerings are non-credit activities combining fun and intellectual awareness. They are scheduled for a limited time (e.g. one semester), are led by a staff or faculty member or by a student working in concert with a faculty or staff member, and are funded by the Office of Student Life. They differ from curricular offerings in that they are not graded and attendance is not strictly enforced. They differ from extra-curricular activities in that they have an intellectual component, faculty/staff leadership, and limited lifespan. Examples of recent co-curricular offerings include: Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy, Conversations about the Law, Current Events Table, FoodLab, Gender and Engineering, Latin Dance, Metal Casting, Play with Clay, Puzzling and Trivial Phenomenon, Science Fiction Book Club, and Whose Improv Is It Anyway? 

Academic Advising 
Coursework and advising are different aspects of the same process — developing a well-educated person. Olin College views advising as a central role of our faculty. Students’ relationships with their advisers are among the most important ones they will establish here and can have a significant impact on their Olin education. The advising system includes individual advising, advising families, extended advising families, the Sibbs program, and Annual Reports and CVs. 

Individual Advising 
Every student has an Olin faculty member as an adviser. Every adviser’s goal is to facilitate students’ academic and personal development throughout their education at Olin. Although they help students with courses and other academic choices, their most vital responsibility is to help advisees manage the difficulties and stresses inherent in any academic setting. Students meet with their advisers regularly all four years, at a rate determined by the student and the adviser. 
Advisers are not around just to approve courses or discuss academics. They serve a variety of functions including mentoring, crisis awareness and support, discussing Annual Reports and CVs, providing institutional and career information, and helping students find a balance among curricular, co-curricular and extracurricular activities. Students should view advisers as helpful resources for whatever issues they are dealing with — academic, social or personal. When advisers do not have the needed information or expertise, they help find someone who does. 
Students may remain with one adviser throughout or change advisers at the formal “adviser request period” at the end of each academic year. A student wishing to switch advisers at other times may discuss this with Assistant Dean of Student Life Alison Black. 
¦ STUDENT LIFE




Olin wants advising to be successful and will do whatever we can to make this relationship supportive, positive and effective. 

Advising Families 
Individual advising relationships are set within advising families consisting of all a faculty member’s advisees, and extended families consisting of three faculty members and their advisees. Students will often meet individually or in advising families with their primary adviser. Other times they will meet with some or all of the other advisers and students in their extended families. Families and extended families vary in their activities, but all provide a structure for incoming students to meet upper-class students, allow for cross class meetings and discussions, give students multiple faculty perspectives, and plan periodic social activities. Students are strongly encouraged to take part in initiating and organizing advising family and extended advising family activities; funds are available from the Office of Student Life. 

Sibbs Program 
The Sibbs program builds bridges (hence the double “b”) between first-year and upper class students. Volunteer upper-class Sibbs (often from the same advising family) “adopt” a first-year to help him or her adjust to the unique culture, quirks and inside information of Olin. They contact their incoming Sibb over the summer to answer questions before arrival. Early in the year, Sibb pairs get together for a meal at least weekly. Upper-class Sibbs also introduce their first-year Sibbs to people and places in the area by inviting them to do several activities during the fall. The most important role, however, is to talk with, answer questions from, give information to, and generally be available to the incoming student. If either member of the Sibb pair feels that the relationship is not working well, they should discuss this with each other or contact Assistant Dean of Student Life Alison Black. 

Annual Reports and CVs 
Throughout their time at Olin, students will write and revise Annual Reports and CVs; these documents will be shared with advisers when appropriate. The purpose of writing these documents and discussing them with advisers is to help students choose wisely from the myriad of curricular, co-curricular and extracurricular options available and make adjustments to get the most out of their Olin experience. The CV is a listing of the activities across the Learning Continuum the student has participated in each semester. CVs provide a helpful background for meeting with advisers to plan for the future as well as for writing resumes for job or internship applications. In the Annual Report, students reflect on the challenges and successes of the year and set goals for the future. 
Students will have the opportunity to develop their Annual Reports and CVs through workshops offered by the Office of Student Life. Students are encouraged to keep these documents up to date and submit them to their adviser regularly. Certain activities, such as registering for courses or passionate pursuits, are impacted by having Annual Reports and CVs up to date. Students who change advisers should submit recent copies of these documents to their new adviser by their first meeting. 
Prior to the commencement of their first year at Olin, new students will be asked to submit educational and personal goals to their adviser. These goals can then be used to assist the student in the development of their first Annual Report. 


Community Service 
Mission 
One of the guiding missions of Olin College is to instill a spirit and practice of “giving back” among students through significant and ongoing service to the community. Philanthropy was the central force in the F. W. Olin Foundation and Olin College since its inception and Olin College is committed to supporting and continuing this tradition among its students, faculty and staff. Olin College encourages community service by providing financial support through the Office of Student Life and reserving time dedicated to community service weekly in the schedule. To learn more about community service at Olin and how you can be involved, read on! For more information visit: http://serv.olin.edu 



Structure 

The Organization to Support, Encourage, and Recognize Volunteerism (SERV) helps students, faculty, and staff get involved with a variety of community service activities at Olin. SERV consists largely of individual community service projects which involve groups of students, faculty and staff who meet regularly to do community service. Any member of the Olin community may start a project. Each project selects its own leader who is responsible for all aspects of the project including getting volunteers, determining budget needs, coordinating with the appropriate outside organizations and making necessary practical arrangements. SERV is available throughout to provide advice and support. 
Project leaders attend periodic meetings of the Association of Project Leaders (APL). At APL meetings, project leaders report on individual projects and discuss common issues and concerns across projects. They consider ways to coordinate projects and generally support and improve the functioning of community service at Olin. 

SERV is governed by seven elected student officers and three faculty/staff advisers who foster community awareness, increase involvement in community service activities and generally work to support and coordinate community service activities at Olin. They coordinate with outside groups seeking volunteers, plan one-time and whole community events, maintain the website (http://serv.olin.edu), charter projects, make budgeting decisions and generally deal with community service concerns that arise throughout the year. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the SERV officers for the 2007–2008 academic year.

–EFC  
Unmet Need  

Students and their families may also elect to apply for educational loans to help cover a portion or all of the EFC. Families who are interested in pursuing loans and/or a monthly tuition management program are encouraged to contact MEFA, the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, at 1-800-449-MEFA. 
Please direct any questions regarding need-based assistance to our financial aid officer in the Student Accounts and Records (StAR) Center at 781-292-2340. 



Outside Scholarship Policy 

All students are expected to pursue outside merit scholarships (local, regional, and national). These scholarships bring distinction to the student and to Olin. If the scholarship is nonrestricted, the funds can be applied to billed expenses including room, meal plan, required laptop purchase and other educational expenses. If the scholarship is restricted to tuition only, it reduces the amount of the Olin Scholarship accordingly. The total of all scholarships, grants, and self-help cannot exceed the total Olin College student budget. Please note that outside scholarships may affect the amount of need-based assistance a student is eligible to receive from Olin College. 
National Merit/Achievement Finalists who win either a National Merit or National Achievement Scholarship from the National Merit Scholarship Corporation or another corporate sponsor are able to use this scholarship at Olin College and will be identified as National Merit/Achievement Scholars. However, finalists who designate Olin College as their first choice college but do not receive a NMSC or corporate-sponsored scholarship will remain National Merit Finalists, since Olin does not currently sponsor National Merit or National Achievement scholarships. 

Olin Scholarship Policy 

The Olin College tuition scholarship is for eight consecutive semesters of full-time study. Anyone permanently disqualified to attend or return to Olin College for academic or disciplinary reasons will forfeit the remaining portion of the scholarship. Study Away (which requires pre-approval) or an internship for credit counts as one of the eight scholarship semesters; the student is expected to pay for costs associated with any such activity, including host institution tuition and fees (if required). For mid-semester leaves of absence, the partial semester counts as one of the eight scholarship semesters; payment of tuition is required for any semester(s) beyond eight before graduation. For end-ofsemester leaves of absence, the semester on leave does not count as one of the eight scholarship semesters (unless the student requests transfer credit for this semester). Olin College provides accommodations for documented disabilities. In extenuating circumstances, exceptions may be granted by the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

Academic Partnerships 
The purpose of Olin’s academic partnerships is to enhance Olin students’ opportunities for learning, growth, and career development. 
A close partner is also our closest neighbor, Babson College. Babson, known for its commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship, is the perfect partner for an engineering college that wants to incorporate business and entrepreneurial thinking into its curriculum. Wellesley College and Brandeis University are also strong partners and provide our students access to a wide range of exceptional courses. 
Babson College Partnership 
The Olin/Babson partnership builds on exciting synergies between business and engineering to enhance the resources and opportunities available to both institutions for innovative teaching, learning and research. Olin faculty work closely with the Babson faculty to develop modules in entrepreneurship and business basics that are integrated into the Olin curriculum. Babson College has recently introduced a M.S. in Management in Technological Entrepreneurship tailored for Olin students. The two institutions have also made several joint faculty appointments, and sponsor a joint academic center, the Sloan Center for Online Education (SCOLE). 

Cross-registration Agreements 
Olin has cross-registration agreements with Babson College, Wellesley College, and Brandeis University to increase the academic offerings available to Olin students in the natural sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences. These agreements also bring students from Wellesley, Brandeis and Babson to our courses, thereby enriching the academic environment at Olin. Through international study opportunities — including a number of joint agreements and special arrangements coordinated by the Olin Study Away Program — the opportunities for learning and growth literally extend from the Olin campus to the whole world. 

Partnerships with Industry 
As students move through the Olin program, the college’s hands-on approach is designed to provide increasing opportunities for corporate experiences and real-world learning. Olin has reached out to the local high-tech community, home to some of the most innovative companies in the world, to provide these learning experiences, including internships and corporate sponsorship of research and design projects. Moreover, Olin is seeking to involve corporations and corporate leaders in the development of the college in such areas as curriculum, career planning, and student recruitment. Many of the most innovative companies have representatives on Olin’s President’s Council.
