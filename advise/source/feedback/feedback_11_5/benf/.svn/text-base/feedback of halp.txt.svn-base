brief walkthrough 
web2.0 style 
"drag x to y to do z"
"drag course off the grid to remove it" (or a small x button in the right corner of the box?)


only show for chosen major.
I'm not interested in M:E reqs.


don't choose major under "options" the word "options" makes me think of other things

add custom course form, can be simple

bug: can't see results of search

you must be logged in to log in as guest? 





"click for description"

include course nicknames "poe, modcon"


perhaps the "box", Chem/Matsci 
could have a drop-down menu for (temporarily) choosing one of the courses inside?

maybe always show the credit totals - nice interface feedback


as seen in screenshot:
"add semester" button. Not everyone graduates in 4 years.

give warning if course is on there twice.

left - to right stacking

ie7
	shows an error in the bottom left
	sometimes tries to select text when you want to drag a course - annoying
	
ui - pauses when dragging and dropping (ff2) prob. ok if faster in ff3

"click to show options"
this is unclear, and doesn't seem to do anything.
