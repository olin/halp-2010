What about all my courses at other colleges?

Let me do a define-your-own course thing, where I can enter some data and stick it on my schedule.

Alternatively, have another screen where you can define courses that no one else has defined yet.  That way, they only have to be done once.  And if there's two of the same course, they can be reported as duplicates.  And if, say, enough people report them as duplicates, they become only one entry.

On that note, it would be great to have a collaborative dictionary of classes to take.

Need a full year of SCOPE.

Want to be able to re-arrange courses that I already have put within a semester.

The requirements buckets are alright, but apart from the small scroll bar at the bottom, there's no way to tell that there are more buckets than you currently see, i.e. design, ahs+e, ece, etc.

For the standard Olin laptop screen size and resolution, make it such that the credits bucket doesn't require scrolling in either direction.

One of my main concerns is the fact that the reason paper is so much better than an excel spreadsheet for this is that when I do registration, I often have like 5 or more possible semester plans that work out.  Now this is more for registration than long term planning, but it would be interesting to have some room for multiple "future possible plans".  I know that's really what's kept me from doing this all digitally anyways.

Have things searchable by common names.

The arrows that expand and contract the bottom buckets are confusing and unneccessary.

Only show me buckets for the things that apply to my major.

Why do the semester dates have a drop-down?  That's really un-useful and a bit bloated.

I'd like to see a more definite line at the 16 credit mark.
