The "all courses" view is now floated, so that search terms won't disappear.
The view now resizes vertically as well as horizontally
Courses disappear from the dragging box while they're being dragged (no more "duplicating")
To reduce information overload, the descriptions are now loaded only when the course is clicked
Courses are now colorized by type of class
Metacourse boxes are now draggable separately from courses (it's still a bit buggy)
