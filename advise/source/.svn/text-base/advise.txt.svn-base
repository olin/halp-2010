Things to try:
Log in - primitive security (safe against injection, but that's about it - info is sent plaintext over POST).
Drag a course onto the schedule. It should snap to a semester.
Move courses from place to place on the schedule, and drag them off.
Rules update as courses move.
Click on a rule to see courses that will satisfy that requirement.
Click on a rule grouping to expand or collapse that group. Group status icons should properly update.
The "number of credits" rules should properly update, and work correctly for courses with heterogeneous credits (eg Error Control Codes)
Search in the box for course codes (MTH 1110, for example), course titles, or faculty names.
Saving/loading of a single schedule (logging out and logging back in again should produce the same schedule)
Semesters are selectable for leave of absence, etc. The selection should persist from session to session
Selecting a major (via "Options") will update the list of requirements and persist between sessions. The majors in the catalog are currently implemented.
Printing support via @media CSS directive (try print preview)
Should work in IE 6+, Firefox 3+, Safari 3+

Not yet implemented:
Courses not in catalog
Additional course information on mouseover
Custom reorganization within a semester
What to do about registration: will everyone be pre-registered?
Credit accounting if a course is failed
Distinguishing between completed courses and planned courses
When a four-year plan should be formulated - when do "warnings" become "errors"?
Discussed with Jayesh
	Course colorcoding
	A "sandbox" for courses a user is interested in taking
	Separate "advisor" and "student" views
	Changing the interface to have requirements more clearly identified and listed on the side
	A "pile" of courses in one place on a review, instead of in the lower interface
